Explore the Go language by writing tests

Get a grounding with TDD. Go is a good language for learning TDD because it is a simple language to learn and testing is built-in

Be confident that you'll be able to start writing robust, well-tested systems in Go

Watch a video, or read about why unit testing and TDD is important
